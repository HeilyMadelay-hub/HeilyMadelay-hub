# 🚀 I build backend systems that scale without breaking

## 👋 Hi, I'm Heily

Full Stack Developer specialized in **.NET** and **Python**.  
I design APIs, clean architectures, and AI-powered systems that solve real business problems.  
I work with teams that value **quality, security, and reliable deployment**.

---

## 🧠 What I solve

**Backend systems that work in production**, not just locally:

- Scalable REST APIs with clean architecture (DDD, Repository Pattern)
- AI integration in real products (RAG, embeddings, LLMs)
- Database migrations with zero data loss and zero downtime
- Process automation that saves hours of manual work
- Real-time systems with WebSockets and concurrent transactions

**I don't build pretty prototypes that don't work. I build systems that handle real traffic.**

---

## 🧩 How I work

My process is designed to deliver value from day one:

1. **I understand the business problem** before writing code  
   → I don't assume. I ask, document, and validate with the client.

2. **I design architecture thinking about future scalability**  
   → Microservices when it makes sense, monoliths when it's more efficient.

3. **I prioritize testing, documentation, and automated deployment**  
   → If it's not tested and documented, it's not finished.

4. **I iterate based on real feedback and metrics**  
   → I don't fall in love with code. What matters is that it works for the user.

## 🎯 My professional approach

**Quality > speed** (but without analysis paralysis)  
→ Clean code is not optional, it's professionalism.

**The best architecture is the one the team understands**  
→ I don't design to impress, I design so it works and can be maintained.

**Production-ready means: it works, it's secure, it's tested**  
→ I don't deliver "almost ready" code. If it's in production, it has to hold up.

**I document as if I won't be there tomorrow**  
→ Code is read more times than it's written.
