# 🚀 I build backend systems that scale without breaking

## 👋 Hi, I'm Heily

Full Stack Developer specialized in **.NET** and **Python**.  

I design production-ready APIs, clean architectures, and AI-powered systems that solve real business problems. I work with teams that value **quality, security, and reliable deployment**.

---

## 🧠 What I do

I build **backend systems that work in production**, not just locally:

- AI integration in real products (RAG, embeddings, LLMs)
- Scalable REST APIs (Clean Architecture, DDD)
- Zero-downtime database migrations
- Process automation that saves hours of manual work
- Real-time systems with WebSockets and concurrent transactions

**I don't build pretty prototypes. I build systems that handle real traffic.**

---

## 🧩 How I work

- I understand the business problem before writing code
- I design architecture thinking about scalability and maintainability
- I prioritize testing, documentation, and automated deployment
- I iterate based on real feedback and metrics
