# 🚀 Backend-focused developer building production-oriented systems

## 👋 Hi, I'm Heily

**Backend-focused Full Stack Developer** interested in scalable APIs, clean architectures, and AI-powered systems.

I enjoy building systems designed for **real usage scenarios**, focusing on **maintainability, reliability, and clear architecture decisions**. I’m currently looking for my first professional engineering role where I can contribute, learn fast, and grow within a strong technical team.

---

## 🧠 What I do

I build backend-centric projects that simulate **production-like environments and real business workflows**:

- AI integration in applications (RAG, embeddings, LLM APIs)
- REST APIs using Clean Architecture principles
- Database migrations designed to avoid downtime
- Process automation tools
- Real-time systems with WebSockets and concurrent operations

My focus is not only making software work, but making it **understandable, maintainable, and deployable**.

## 🧩 How I work

- I understand the problem before implementing solutions
- I design systems thinking about long-term maintainability
- I prioritize testing, documentation, and reproducible environments
- I iterate based on feedback and measurable behavior
